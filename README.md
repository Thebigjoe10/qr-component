## My Development Journey

### Technologies I Used

During the journey of crafting this project, I leveraged the following technologies:

- **HTML5**: I structured the project using the power of semantic HTML5 markup.
- **CSS**: For that aesthetic touch, I used custom CSS with some cool CSS custom properties.
- **React**: The star of the show is the QR code component, which I built with React.

### What I Learned

As I embarked on this development journey, I picked up some valuable lessons:

- **React Component Structure**: I honed my skills in structuring React components effectively. The codebase is well-organized and modular, making it a breeze to work with.

- **CSS Styling**: I had a blast applying CSS styles to create a visually appealing and responsive QR code component. It's amazing how CSS can transform a project!

- **Development Workflow**: I fine-tuned my development workflow, embracing best practices for version control and project organization. It's all about staying organized and efficient!

## The Building Blocks

In the provided code, you'll find some essential building blocks:

- **HTML Structure**: Peek into the `index.html` file to see the foundation of the web page. I included the root element for React (`<div id="root"></div>`) and references to the necessary CSS and JavaScript files.

- **React Component**: The real star is the `QRcomponent` React component, defined in `main.jsx`. It beautifully showcases the QR code and accompanying text.

### CSS Magic

I sprinkled some CSS magic to style the QR code component:

- **Container**: The `.container` class works its magic to center the component both vertically and horizontally. It's all about that perfect alignment!

- **Card**: The `.card` class defines the visual style of the card that houses the QR code and text. It's got properties for width, height, background color, borders, border-radius, and a delightful box-shadow.

- **Card Image**: Inside the card, the `img` is styled to ensure it fits snugly within the card's boundaries. It even has a subtle border-radius for that finishing touch!

- **Card Info**: The `.card-info` class adds the final touches to the text content within the card. The `h2` and `p` elements have specific styling for text alignment, fonts, and spacing. It's all about that perfect readability!
